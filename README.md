# SAFE-Smart-Alerts-for-Emergencies-
SAFE (Smart Alerts for Emergencies) is a smart emergency alert and disaster management system developed using the .NET framework and C#. The project aims to provide a reliable platform for sending real-time alerts and managing emergency situations efficiently.

The system allows administrators to broadcast instant alerts to the public during critical events like natural disasters, accidents, fires, or public health threats. Users can also report emergencies through the platform by sharing location details and descriptions, helping authorities respond faster.

SAFE includes features like a centralized dashboard, live location tracking, a resource directory (for hospitals, shelters, etc.), and secure communication channels between users and responders. It improves coordination, reduces response time, and helps save lives by ensuring timely action during emergencies.
